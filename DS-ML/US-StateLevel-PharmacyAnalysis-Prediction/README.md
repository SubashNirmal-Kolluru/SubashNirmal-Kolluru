# EDA and Analysis of Pharmacy Data

This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and modeling of pharmacy data in the USA, merged with demographic and healthcare-related data to analyze pharmacy distribution, its correlation with various demographic and health factors, and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

- **Data Sources**:
  - **Pharmacy Data**: Contains information about pharmacies in the USA.
  - **Demographic Data**: Includes population demographics for counties and states.

- **Main Tasks**:
  1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove unwanted words, handle missing values, and standardize data columns.
  2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and correlation analysis to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
  3. **Predictive Modeling**: Multiple machine learning models to predict pharmacy distribution based on demographic and health factors.
  4. **PCA**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.
