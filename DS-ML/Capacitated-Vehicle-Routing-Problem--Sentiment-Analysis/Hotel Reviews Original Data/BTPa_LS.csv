A full plate is more than sufficient for two persons. A person visiting alone is left with no other option of either packing half of the food or letting it waste. The waiters are busy half of the time watching the television and are not available to cater to the needs of the diners.,4 weeks ago,"<span class=""_pxg _Jxg"" aria-label=""Rated 1.0 out of 5,""><span style=""width:14px""></span></span>"
