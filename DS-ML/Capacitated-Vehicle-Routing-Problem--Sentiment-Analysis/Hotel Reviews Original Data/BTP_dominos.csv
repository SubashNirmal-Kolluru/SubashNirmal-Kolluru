lake ashok raja patrudu,Nice and best hangout place for any pizza lover. You must try domino's pizza if you haven't yet touched soft bread of pizza. They have n no if varient pizzas in menu. And it starts from 50 rupees to 900. Daily offers are best if you are on party.

But why two star less is, the day when i ordered and i want to be delivered at my home (barbetia), they told NO, they can't do home delivery. Not only that, they didn't took my order either thru phone or online. I went to the shop and ordered, which is frustrating again becuase after that i waited 30 mins to get my order. Atleast they could take the order online or by phone, so that by the time i reached there for pickup, my order should be ready. Well As of now in this location i ordered only once. So i dont know what about other days. May be its my bad luck. But they have to think Dominos is a brand (its not like ""kharagpur Local pizza"" shop), and they need to maintain consistency.

Someday the pizzas taste exceptional and some other day, it's out right bland... The tables are not cleaned and are cleaned only when you ask them.
