The specials are also good to have.However, there is a lack of drinks on the menu. Better call and reserve tables, as it can get quite busy by 8 in the evening. Recommend sitting in the area upstairs on the 1st floor than the one at the entrance for a better ambiance.",,

Manager Samir is too much inexperienced to handle a hotel business. Bad behaviour. All staffs need soft skill training. Food not so good. Will never recommend anybody to stay in this hotel. Foul smell inside hotel room. Hotel is near main road so you will always get noisy environment.Overall very pathetic experience.,,

You are sitting over the table putting the legs on the chair. It was looking odd so I requested the captain to tell you seat properly. I think he has doing his duty and he do not misbehaving with you intentionally.    The staffs are very polite and well behaved and food quality is awesome. I think the best hotel in kharagpur.",,

Our group didn't like their main course. They claim to have Mainland China cooks but I've been to Mainland China a lot of times and it's nowhere near them. Also, they don't pay GST most probably. They've written ""taxes extra"" on their menu but when we asked them why they didn't put taxes, he gave a sly smile and said we have to pay taxes only if we pay by debit card which indicates all other business is not billed. They also don't give electronic bills, so they can totally hide these earnings. I study at IIT Kharagpur so I went to this place as it's near our campus. They treat their customers as if we're inferior to them. We were unnecessarily subject to statements like, ""Aap Kabhi khaye Nahi honge Magnum aur Kabhi khaenge bhi Nahi to abhi kha lijiye"" meaning ""I'm sure you never would have had Magnum ice-cream in your life, and you will never have it again, so you might as well have it now."" This was when I told him that I've had Magnum a lot of times and I'll try another ice-cream this time. Their waiters don't know what's there on their menu so they tell you to try the generic Manchow Soup and Schezwan fried rice. When we said that we've had Manchow soup before and would like to try their Korean fried rice, the waiter again said, ""Aapne Kabhi khaya nahi hoga aapko pata Nahi hai shayad, ye try Kar lijiye"" which means ""You must have never eaten this so you don't know what it is, try the Manchow soup not Korean fried rice."" Ultimately he didn't bring the Korean fried rice and when we asked for it, he said that we never ordered it. They charged us Rs. 40 for an ice-cream of Rs. 15 (267%), Rs. 30 for a cold drink of Rs. 15. We thought it was an honest mistake so we went to clarify after paying the bill. We were extremely polite seeing as they were elder to us. But they started insulting us saying that we'd never been to a restaurant so didn't know what it is like. When I told them (again politely) that you must have made a mistake, restaurants generally charge 5-10 rs extra proportional to the price of the product, he replied ""Aap Gaye hi kitni achchi jagah honge, aap ko pata Nahi hai ki achche restaurant me kaise hota hai, aisa hi hota hai, aapko yaha bithake khilaya na uska paisa hai ye. Pata Nahi kaise log aate hai"" meaning ""You must have never been to a good restaurant in your whole life, it is like this. It's the money we charge for giving you a place to sit. People don't know what it's like to go to a good restaurant and then tell us. Lord knows what kind of people come here!"" I'm from Mumbai and was not going to take any such insults so I told him that I'm from Mumbai and no restaurant even speaks to their customers like this. Their ice-creams were half melted, even the Magnum that we ultimately ordered was half melted and refrozen which made it taste horrible. So ultimately they returned 50 Rs out of the extra Rs. 80 they'd charged just because they realised we're from IIT and they'd be spoiling their market base. But if we'd been localites, I think they would have insulted us for one more hour.",,
