Ordered some food, only half the things ordered were delivered to my apartment. they pick and choose which items they want to deliver. if you order Roti and Sabzi, it is possible only Roti arrives. Speaking of Roti, it was ice cold by the time it reached me. when i complained, the guy on the phone was rather rude and said Roti is made all at once and stored in caserole and is naturally cold!  I will never order from here again and would advice you also to avoid this place..I gave a single star because zero stars is not allowed",a year ago,"<span class=""_pxg _Jxg"" aria-label=""Rated 1.0 out of 5,""><span style=""width:14px""></span></span>"
