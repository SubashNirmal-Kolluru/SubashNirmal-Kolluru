The quality of the food ingredients are not standard in comparison with priced charged for.And the preparation of the food is poor standard if I compare with its price.Simply, the quality, quantity, standard and preparation of the food needs more and more rectification."
"Reviews5",-1,"Worst food ever. They  serve good food in festivals only. In normal days they are worst in taste. And service is also not good. The servants constantly stares at you at the time of eating. Their food is such disgusting that will make you stomach upset I suggest not to visit there if you want a good health"
