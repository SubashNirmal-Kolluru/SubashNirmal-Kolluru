Easily noticeable from the road, a 3 storeyed red colored building. It has total of 16 clean & comfortable rooms for accomodation and also a restaurant for those who want to go for a meal while travelling via Kharagpur. The food is great. If u order they take almost 20 mins to bring the food, but the food is hot, fresh and tasty. It also has a bar on the ground floor. Overall a wonderful place for a quick break while travelling that way."
