"Reviews12",0,"Food quality is horrible! Previously this place used to be good, when it just kicked off their business here in kgp.But, now? A BIG NO NO. …MoreFood quality is horrible! Previously this place used to be good, when it just kicked off their business here in kgp.But, now? A BIG NO NO.Firstly, the quality has gone down drastically. Go there if you want to eat old stuff! Trust me, it is!Secondly, the staff service is so so poor. Order and get yourself locked there on the chair for the next couple of hours for the food to reach you.Thirdly, the pricing is as high as it could get. Food prices are not actually worth it. Local hotels around, will provide you better food at lesser price.I took time to review this place b'coz I just don't want people going there to be ill after one or two days of consuming their food..Worst quality food for higher price?You decide!"
