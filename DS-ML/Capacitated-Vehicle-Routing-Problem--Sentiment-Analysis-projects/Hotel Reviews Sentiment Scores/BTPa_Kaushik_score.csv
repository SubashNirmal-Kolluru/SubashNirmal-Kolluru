Its situated around 15km from the campus on the Mumbai highway. Rooms are decent with comfortable bed, fridge in the room and hot water in bathroom. A standard 3 star situation with the facilities.However, one should note that the hotel also has a restaurant cum club cum dance bar on the ground floor and it gets loud at night in there. While its quite safe for families people might want to avoid late night restaurant visits if with family.Overall a distant alternative to IIT guest house if you have to must visit and stay in town. Definitely way better than Hotel Park situated next door to IIT Gate."
