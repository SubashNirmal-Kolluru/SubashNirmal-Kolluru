Ordered biryani online and waited for three hours to get delivered inside the IIT Campus. Made numerous phone calls only to listen to their ""10 minutes"" fake excuses. Finally got a return call asking if the order should be delivered.Being a regular customer since their inception I can see that there is a definite change in attitude in serving the customers, from when to stared few months back till today. Waiters are roaming here and there but not taking orders, on top of that they are not even listening to the call.WILL NOT GO THERE AGAIN. Same with my friends who missed their dinner tonight."

"Reviews4",0,"This is a place famous for its Biryani located between the two railway crossings just after the main gate of IIT. ‚Ä¶MoreThis is a place famous for its Biryani located between the two railway crossings just after the main gate of IIT.One can enjoy the biryani here or can get it delivered to their respective hall or places.They provide different styles of biryani here. Although their chicken biryani (hyderabadi style) is liked most.It is at a walking distance of at max 5mins from the IIT main Gate.Always call them if they are open or not and ask them about the availability of biryani because sometimes it gets over before you reach there to munch on it... üòÇ"
