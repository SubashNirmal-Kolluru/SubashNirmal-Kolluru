In particular, avoid this restaurant for lunch  as you have chance to eat food from the previous day. This place is good for dinner. Avoid taking thali unless price is an issue. Do not order randomly. Politely ask the waiter for his honest recommendations about the food.  You may have a chance to eat the best food in the campus in lowest price.",2 months ago,"<span class=""_pxg _Jxg"" aria-label=""Rated 4.0 out of 5,""><span style=""width:56px""></span></span>"

So if you are here in the campus for some work or student you have limited choice for food. Keeping in view that its inside campus and meant to cater to the needs of students. The food I say is quite average. The taste is just about okay. However the quantity is perhaps on a lesser side keeping in view the cost they charge.Ambience is just okay. They both inside and outside / garden sitting facility. Inside is air-conditioned ( though cooling is questionable).The also got takeaway option. The service is pathetic, you may have to wait for long if you won't order in one go. We have chicken tikka masala and Biryani.",7 months ago,"<span class=""_pxg _Jxg"" aria-label=""Rated 3.0 out of 5,""><span style=""width:42px""></span></span>"

We had ordered a chicken 65 dish along with 3 tandori rotis for takeaway. At dinner time we realised it was not chicken but small pieces of mushroom that were given. We first thought parcels might have been exchanged but after bringing up the issue with the owner ( mr sarkar), we realised mushroom 65 is not even on the menue and since we had eaten chicken 65 previously at the same place,  we knew how it tastes or looked like. But shocking of everything was behaviour of the owner...he was uncouth and arrogant. After speaking for sometime with him it was clear that this was not a mistake but deliberately done, probably to save cost...but it is a strategy used by them. Therefore would request all to check and re check orders , particularly takeaways from dreamland.

You end up thanking the almighty for finally having been served your order.and ofcourse the staff do feel it a favor on you.Food is ok as per the locale. But, nothing out of the world.See how much time I have to write a longish review as I wait to be served.Better try the time tested Heritage restaurant barely 500m away, than wasting your time here. Unless you like to wait endlessly though.Only saving grace is the taste of food, but, that is quickly marred by the mosquito bites and the smell from the urinal nearby.That is all folks let me enjoy some chat with my friends also.
