It's nothing more than a lovenest for IITians living there. The rooms are smelly, there are spider webs everywhere, the bedsheets are torn, the pillows are filthy, there is no geyser in the room and the whole place is full of mosquitoes.Oh! And the waiter literally took out a cockroach fromhe plate in front of me and gave the same plate back again!Just so disgusting!",,

I have gone there once and have personal experience. Entrance is so spacious that car can go through the parking of the hotel. But the rooms of this hotel not very spacious and conjested in some extent. The passage is thin and  all the rooms are in serial way. Though the rooms are tidy enough to rest for some time. In overall perspective the hotel is somewhat presentable.,,
