# Multi-Label Classification with PCA, Feature Engineering, and Ensemble Model

This project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for multi-label classification. The code integrates several key components, including data preprocessing, feature selection using PCA, and an ensemble model leveraging TabNet for predictions. The model is designed for a classification problem where the goal is to predict multiple labels for each data sample.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and transforming categorical data.
- **Feature Selection**: Utilizing PCA and variance encoding for effective feature extraction.
- **Modeling**: Using a custom neural network model with advanced techniques such as label smoothing and multi-fold validation.
- **Ensemble Strategy**: Combining multiple models to improve predictive accuracy.
- **Custom Loss Function**: Implementing a custom loss function for model training and inference.
